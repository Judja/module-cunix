### Objectives
* Learn about shell
* Implement a series of basic commands: `echo`, `ls`, `env`, `export`, `exit`

### Actions
* Go to the course directory `cd cep/courses/cunix/ex11/` 
* Read all files in include/ src/ and the Makefile before starting anything
* Enter `make test` and see if your program works properly
* After building the source, run `./minishell` from the project root to run your program

### Bonus
